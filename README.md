# GEOSTORY

Repository for the project of Electro Publishing and Digital Storytelling. The aim is to make a geospatial analysis of the digital archive of ARTchives explaining if there is a relationship between the country and the citizenship of the arthistorians, keepers and collections from a distributional point of view.
